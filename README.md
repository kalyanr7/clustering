<h1>This repository consists implementations of Popular Clustering Algorithms.</h1>

<ul>
  <li><h4>Meanshift Clustering:</h4></li><p>meanshift is newer and less known algorithm, It doesn't require selecting the number of clusters in advance, but instead just requires a bandwidth to be specified, which can be easily chosen automatically.It can handle clusters of any shape, whereas k-means (without using special extensions) requires that clusters be roughly ball shaped.</p>
